## Approach & Efficiency
My first approach was to make one big function, that of course didn't work. I had to re-watch class and some other YT vids to figure out how to actually change the pointer directions.

## Solution

I still can't figure out how to get an image into this file from my phone. I have it saved to my computer though.
